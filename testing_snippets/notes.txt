1. typically ,it is not a unittest if it involves a filesystem, database, network.
2. follow arrange(setup), act(call functionality), assert in writing a testcase for elegant design.

what is unittesting for:
1. understand what to build, unittest forces the developer to think how a unit is used.
2. document the units 
3. design the units (decompose code into testable units, loose coupling and hight cohesion)
4. regression failure  or regression testing ( ensure previously developed and tested software still performs after a change)

Limitations of unittesting:
1. hard to write if units have many dependencies (high coupling)
2. test scenarios may not occur in production.
3. tests may not notice failure ( test are not able to cover scenarios that occur in production)
4. unittests do not find integration or non functional(like security and performance) problems


testfixture - code to construct and configure a unit under test to get it ready to be tested.
